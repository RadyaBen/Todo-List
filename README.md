## About The Project

Todo List is a task management app whose main goal is to help users stay organized and manage their day-to-day tasks. A user has the ability to add, delete, filter a task by specific filters, and mark it as completed. Also, for convenience, there is a search field that allows a user to quickly find a desired task. With this app, a user can complete goals without wasting time trying to figure out priorities.
